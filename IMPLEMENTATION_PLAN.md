# napariTissueGraph — Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**napariTissueGraph** is a napari plugin for quantifying tissue topology, rearrangement dynamics, and junction mechanics from microscopy data. It replaces and extends napariCellFlow.

The tool takes cell positions over time (from nuclear tracking or segmentation labels) and builds a dynamic graph representation of the tissue. It tracks junction lengths, detects T1 transitions (cell intercalation events), computes cell-level statistics, and optionally maps traction force data onto junction edges.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Layered architecture**: Each layer builds on the previous. Users get analysis depth proportional to their input data.
2. **External tools for segmentation and tracking**: This tool does NOT do segmentation or tracking. It accepts their outputs.
3. **TFM/MSM is optional**: Force mapping enriches the analysis but is never required.
4. **Two input paths, one internal representation**: Segmentation labels and nuclear tracks both produce the same `TissueGraph` object.
5. **Separation of core logic and GUI**: All analysis code must work without napari. The napari widget is a thin visualization/interaction layer on top.
6. **Multi-tissue first**: The primary output is `TissueGraphDataset` (multiple tissues from one condition). Single-tissue is just a dataset with one entry.

## Architecture

### Layer Model

```
Layer 1: Cell positions over time
  Input: nuclear tracks (N×3 array: frame, y, x) OR segmentation labels (T×H×W array)
  Output: cell positions, velocities, MSD, pairwise distances
  → Available from both input types

Layer 2: Cell graph (Voronoi or segmentation-derived)
  Input: Layer 1 positions OR segmentation labels
  Output: TissueGraph — nodes (cells) with area/shape index, edges (junctions) with lengths/coordinates
  → Available from both input types, but segmentation gives real boundaries

Layer 3: Topology dynamics
  Input: TissueGraph time series from Layer 2
  Output: T1 events, neighbor exchange tracking, edge trajectories with sign convention
  → Requires Layer 2

Layer 4 (optional): Mechanics
  Input: Layer 2 graph + external TFM/MSM force data
  Output: Junction tensions, force-topology correlations
  → Requires Layer 2 + external force data (e.g., from napariTFM)
```

## Data Structures (`structures.py`)

- `CellData` — Per-cell properties at a single timepoint (position, area, perimeter, shape_index, num_neighbors, track_id, vertices)
- `JunctionData` — Per-junction properties (cell_pair, length, coordinates, midpoint; optional tension/stress)
- `T1Event` — T1 transition (frame, losing_pair, gaining_pair, location, all 4 cells)
- `EdgeTrajectory` — Junction tracked through time with sign convention (positive before T1, negative after)
- `TissueGraphFrame` — Graph at one timepoint (networkx graph + cells dict + junctions dict)
- `TissueGraphTimeSeries` — One tissue over time (frames dict + trajectories + T1 events + metadata)
- `TissueGraphDataset` — **Primary output**: collection of TissueGraphTimeSeries (add/remove tissues, condition label, metadata)

---

## Implemented Modules

### `core/graph.py` — Build API

Single-tissue:
- `build_from_labels(label_stack, ..., min_iou) → TissueGraphTimeSeries` — now assigns track IDs via IoU matching and extracts cell vertices
- `build_from_tracks(positions, ..., track_ids, method, lloyd_iterations, lloyd_tol) → TissueGraphTimeSeries` — supports track IDs and Voronoi method selection
- `build_from_trackmate(trackmate_data, ..., method) → TissueGraphTimeSeries` — builds from parsed TrackMate data with track IDs
- `build_from_both(label_stack, trackmate_data, ..., match_threshold) → TissueGraphTimeSeries` — shapes from labels, tracking from TrackMate (nearest-neighbor spot-to-centroid matching)

Multi-tissue (batch):
- `build_from_labels_4d(label_stacks, ...) → TissueGraphDataset` — accepts `Union[np.ndarray, List[np.ndarray]]` for variable-length movies
- `build_from_tracks_4d(positions, ..., method) → TissueGraphDataset` — positions as Nx4 array (tissue_id, frame, y, x)
- `build_from_both_4d(label_stacks, trackmate_data, ...) → TissueGraphDataset` — combined mode for multiple tissues

### `core/voronoi.py` — Voronoi from positions

- `compute_voronoi(positions, image_shape, method, lloyd_iterations, lloyd_tol)` — scipy Voronoi with mirror-point boundary handling; supports standard and Lloyd's relaxation
- `voronoi_to_graph(vor, positions, n_real, image_shape)` — extract cells (with vertices), junctions, networkx graph
- `lloyd_relaxation(positions, image_shape, n_iterations, tol)` — centroidal Voronoi tessellation

- `label_to_vertices(label_frame, cell_id)` — ordered boundary vertices via cv2 contour extraction

### `core/topology.py` — T1 detection

- `detect_t1_events(series)` — frame-to-frame graph comparison, validates 4-cell rosette pattern
- `detect_all_t1_events(dataset)` — batch: runs T1 detection + trajectory building on all tissues

### `analysis/trajectories.py` — Edge trajectories

- `build_edge_trajectories(series, t1_events)` — two-pass: link T1 edges, then fill junction data with sign convention
- `get_t1_trajectories(series)`, `get_stable_trajectories(series, min_frames)`

### `napari/visualization.py` — Layer rendering

- `load_dataset(path) → TissueGraphDataset` — reconstructs from NPZ files
- `load_multiple_datasets(paths) → Dict[str, TissueGraphDataset]` — loads multiple, keyed by condition
- NPZ format: edge lists (no pickle), ragged arrays via flat+offsets, NaN sentinels for None
- Private helpers: `_serialize_tissue`, `_deserialize_tissue`, `_serialize_ragged`, `_deserialize_ragged`

### `napari/widget.py` — Dock widget (two workflows)

- `SingleTissueBuildWorker` — builds one `TissueGraphTimeSeries` with T1 detection + trajectory building
- `BatchBuildWorker` — builds multiple tissues, returns list of `TissueGraphTimeSeries`
- `IOWorker` — save/load dataset in background thread
- `TissueGraphWidget`:
  - Input type selector (Segmentation Labels / Nuclear Tracks / Both)
  - Multi-file loading: labels (.tif) and TrackMate XML(s) — both support multiple files
  - Layer selector for tracks mode (Points layer)
  - Mode-specific parameter panels (Voronoi, tracking, spot-label matching)
  - Parameter inputs (pixel size, time interval, condition) — auto-filled from TrackMate calibration
  - **Build Single**: builds one tissue → preview in napari → "Add to Dataset" or "Discard"
  - **Build All (Batch)**: builds all loaded inputs → adds all to dataset
  - Preview layers prefixed with `[Preview]`, separate from dataset inspection layers
  - **Dataset section**: summary, tissue spinner, Show/Remove tissue, Save/Load/New buttons
  - Dataset accumulates tissues across multiple builds

## Completed: Input Path Refactor (TODO.md)

All items in TODO.md are complete (as of 2026-03-17):
- Three input modes: Segmentation, Nuclear Tracks, Both (Labels + Tracks)
- TrackMate XML parser with calibration and filtered tracks
- Lloyd's relaxation (centroidal Voronoi tessellation)
- IoU-based label tracking for consistent track IDs
- Cell vertex extraction (contours from labels, Voronoi regions from tracks)
- All build APIs updated + widget with mode-specific parameter panels

## Completed: Save/Load and Widget Redesign

- `core/io.py` — `save_dataset()`, `load_dataset()`, `load_multiple_datasets()` with NPZ + metadata.json format
- Widget redesigned with two workflows: Build Single (preview → Add to Dataset) and Build All (Batch)
- Multi-file TrackMate XML loading
- Build Single uses selected file in list, not always first
- Preview layers prefixed `[Preview]`, separate from dataset inspection layers
- Save/Load/New dataset buttons, scrollable layout

## Completed: Staged Pipeline with Visual QC

- Split monolithic `build_from_*` into Stage 1 (graph extraction) and Stage 2 (tracking assignment)
  - `extract_graphs_from_labels()`, `extract_graphs_from_tracks()`, `extract_graphs_from_trackmate()`, `extract_graphs_from_both()` — all produce graphs with `track_id=None`
  - `assign_tracking_labels()`, `assign_tracking_trackmate()` — mutate series in place
  - `has_tracking()` — helper to check if any cell has tracking
  - Original `build_from_*` wrappers preserved (call stage-1 then stage-2), all signatures unchanged
- New QC visualization functions in `napari/visualization.py`:
  - `build_tracked_centroids()` — centroids colored by track_id (gray for untracked)
  - `build_track_breaks()` — marks where tracks start/end mid-series (births/deaths)
  - `build_trajectory_lines()` — junction lines colored by trajectory_id
- Widget redesigned with 4-stage pipeline: Extract → Track → Analyze → Add/Discard
  - `PipelineStage` enum: IDLE → GRAPHS_BUILT → TRACKED → ANALYZED
  - Stage gating: each button enabled only when previous stage completes
  - Per-stage layer management: Stage 1 shows junctions + yellow centroids, Stage 2 replaces with track-colored centroids + break markers, Stage 3 replaces with trajectory-colored junctions + T1 stars
  - Batch mode preserved as monolithic (no per-stage QC)
- 137 tests passing (16 new: 8 in test_staged_pipeline.py, 8 in test_visualization.py)

## Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Cell-level analysis

- `core/tracks.py` — `compute_velocities()`, `compute_msd()`, `compute_velocity_correlation()`
- `analysis/statistics.py` — Shape index distributions, T1 rates (single-tissue + dataset-level), neighbor number distributions
- `analysis/events.py` — Event-triggered averaging of junction length around T1s, pooled across tissues

### Phase 5: Force mapping

- `core/mechanics.py` — `map_traction_forces()`, `map_msm_stress()` (optional Layer 4)

### Testing with real data

- Test staged pipeline: Extract → inspect junctions → Track → inspect colors → Analyze → inspect T1s → Add
- Test widget with 2-3 real segmentation movies of different lengths
- Verify batch mode, Save/Load round-trip, tissue removal all work end-to-end

## Downstream Analysis (NOT part of the plugin)

Analysis and plotting happen in standalone scripts/notebooks:

```python
from napariTissueGraph.core.io import load_dataset, load_multiple_datasets
from napariTissueGraph.analysis.statistics import compute_t1_rates, pool_shape_index_distributions
from napariTissueGraph.analysis.events import event_triggered_average_dataset

datasets = load_multiple_datasets(["data/wt/", "data/ko/", "data/mix/"])
for condition, ds in datasets.items():
    rates = compute_t1_rates(ds)
    print(f"{condition}: T1 rate = {rates.mean():.3f} ± {rates.std()/np.sqrt(len(rates)):.3f}")
```

---

## Style and Code Quality

- Type hints on all public functions
- Docstrings (NumPy style) on all public functions and classes
- No GUI imports in `core/` or `analysis/` modules
- `core/` and `analysis/` must be fully testable without napari running
- Use logging (not print) for debug output
- Keep functions short and focused — prefer composition over inheritance
